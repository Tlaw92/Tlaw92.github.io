   Well, getting close to your thirties can scare you a little bit. The weekends become less important, along with some other priorities becoming more important.  I have always been an office type of person.  Never had any trouble spending 8 hours a day in front of a computer screen.  
	
	I work in the Legal industry with a main background of prepping Affidavits for banks like Bank of America. Prepping an affidavit is all about following a set of procedures depending on certain circumstances.  Boring to some but with music I could Probably do 10 hour shifts and not even notice a difference. 
	
	My first interest in the computer realm was in Cyber Security, so I bought a Udemy.com class on "Ethical Hacking" but had trouble getting too deep into the "class" without outside guidence and haven't tried again since.
	
	I see programing as a lot of things. It's the future of everything. Even in nature it seems we find some form of natural programing within oranisms. I see a lot of issues in the world that programming can not only automate, but fix.
	
	I used to ride a motorcycle and during this period I went down several times and a couple tiimes being on the Freeway here in L.A., right on the 405 South. A car didn't see me before switching out of a Double Lined Carpool lane and hit me going 60 mph.  I'm obviously fortunate to be here and think that the accident should have never happened.
	
	"Teslas" and other autonomous car companies striving for automated driving is our future. We shouldn't even be able to speed. Who cares if we are late. We shouldn't be able to switch lanes if another car is there. I want to one day work for these companies and help literally change the world around me for the better. 
	
	I want to learn what programming can do and adapt it to anything I can in the real world.
